1. We observe the differences in the code of unsafe_home.php and safe_home.php 
The code in safe_home.php has the prepared statement that should block off the attack.

2. The code in unsafe_home.php does not contain the prepared statement, and is what allows us to perform the simple exploit 

3. We used the terminal and used the sudo command with the gedit command to be able to alter the .php file loaded by tbe .html file

4. We right clicked on index.html in var/www/SQLInjection and used open with gedit to update the code to take safe_home.php instead
of unsafe_home.php

5. We prepared the exploit statement from previous tasks.

6. As expected, the exploit no longer works.
